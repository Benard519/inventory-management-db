# ✅ Repository Name Suggestion

For Question 1 (**Inventory Management Database System**), keep the repo name short, clear, and professional. Some good options:

* `inventory-management-db`
* `inventory_system_sql`
* `dbms-inventory-project`
* `mysql-inventory-schema`

👉 I’d recommend: **`inventory-management-db`** (clear, professional, easy to remember).

# 📦 Inventory Management Database (MySQL Project)

Welcome to the **Inventory Management Database System** 🎉  
This project is my submission for the Database Management assignment — Question 1.  
It’s a relational database schema built with **MySQL** to manage products, customers, suppliers, warehouses, sales, and purchases.  

---

## 🛠️ What’s Inside?
This repo contains one main file:  

- **`inventory_management_system.sql`**  
  - Creates the database `inventory_system`  
  - Defines **well-structured tables** with proper constraints  
  - Establishes **relationships** (One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-Many where needed)  
  - Includes **sample data inserts** for testing  
  - Adds a **view** (`vw_product_stock`) to quickly check stock levels  

---

## 🗂️ Database Entities
The schema includes the following tables:
- `categories` 🏷️ – groups products by type  
- `suppliers` 🚚 – tracks suppliers and contacts  
- `warehouses` 🏭 – physical storage locations  
- `products` 📦 – items available for sale or purchase  
- `stock_levels` 📊 – product stock per warehouse  
- `customers` 🙋 – stores customer details  
- `sales_orders` 🧾 – customer orders  
- `sales_order_items` 🛒 – line items within sales orders  
- `purchase_orders` 📥 – orders placed to suppliers  
- `purchase_order_items` 📦 – items received from suppliers  
- `users` 👩‍💻 – system users with roles  

---

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Import the Database
Run the SQL script in your MySQL server:
```bash
mysql -u root -p < inventory_management_system.sql
````

### 2. Verify Installation

Log into MySQL and check:

```sql
USE inventory_system;
SHOW TABLES;
SELECT * FROM vw_product_stock;
```

You should see the list of tables and some **sample data** ready to test.

---

## 🎯 Features & Highlights

* ✅ **Relational schema** with primary keys, foreign keys, unique & not null constraints
* ✅ **Multiple relationships** (1:1, 1\:N, M\:N)
* ✅ **Indexes & views** for better query performance
* ✅ **Sample data** so you can test immediately
* ✅ **Real-world use case**: inventory + sales + purchases

---

## 📌 Submission Details

* **Assignment**: Database Management System (Question 1)
* **Due Date**: Wednesday, 25th September 2025
* **Deliverable**: One `.sql` file in this repository
* **Student**: Benard Atika (University of Eldoret, Computer Science)

---

## 💡 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

If extended, this DB can support:

* Triggers to auto-update stock on sales/purchase
* Stored procedures for re-ordering low stock items
* REST API integration (Node.js or FastAPI → Question 2 option)

---

## ✨ Final Note

This project blends **serious database design** with a touch of fun.
Feel free to fork, test, or suggest improvements.
Let’s keep inventory management less boring and more **organized + awesome!** 🚀

✅ This README has:  
- A clear **intro**  
- List of **tables/entities**  
- **How to run** instructions  
- **Features & highlights**  
- **Submission details** (assignment context)  
- A fun tone (icons + emojis), but still professional

Do you want me to also create a **repository folder structure suggestion** (like having `/sql`, `/docs`, `/README.md`) or should it stay super simple (just the `.sql` + `README.md`)?
